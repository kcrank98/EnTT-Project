This folder shows how to setup a 3D application purely with the EnTT ECS.
To build this project you need to install CMake and have the Vulkan SDK.

Software: 
https://CMake.org
https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/

After installing reboot your machine and run: "cmake -S ./ -B ./build"
in a command prompt located in this folder. The .sln will be in the build folder.

This example only renders a triangle for now but should be expanded into basic asteroids or something.
